## Getting Started

OPDX is designed with privacy and interoperability in mind, allowing users to control the visibility of their profile data while enabling a broad ecosystem of services to access it securely.

### Use Cases

- **Avatar & Profile Retrieval:** Services can display user avatars or other profile information associated with an email address (similar to how Gravatar works).
- **Cross-Service Identity:** OPDX can be used to centralize profile information across different services, allowing seamless integration without needing to re-enter personal details.
