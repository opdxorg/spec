    "content": "OPDX is designed with privacy and interoperability in mind, allowing users to control the visibility of their profile data while enabling a broad ecosystem of services to access it securely. Use Cases . | Avatar &amp; Profile Retrieval: Services can display user avatars or other profile information associated with an email address (similar to how Gravatar works). | Cross-Service Identity: OPDX can be used to centralize profile information across different services, allowing seamless integration without needing to re-enter personal details. | . Quick Start Guide . If youâ€™re a developer looking to integrate OPDX into your application, there are two main areas to focus on: . Client-Side Implementation . The client-side is responsible for fetching and displaying profile data from an OPDX-compatible API (hosted by the email provider or service). Youâ€™ll typically use the userâ€™s email address (hashed for privacy) to make the request and display the profile information in your app. â†’ Learn more . Server-Side Implementation . On the server side, youâ€™ll need to implement an OPDX-compatible API that serves profile data based on an email address. This involves exposing the data through HTTP endpoints, supporting authentication (if necessary), and respecting privacy settings. â†’ Learn more . ",

    "content": "Welcome to the Open Profile Data Exchange (OPDX) protocol specification! . What is OPDX? . OPDX (Open Profile Data Exchange) is a decentralized protocol for retrieving public profile data (such as avatars) associated with an email address. The protocol allows email providers and self-hosted instances to expose profile data in a standardized way, without relying on a centralized service, like Gravatar. Features . | ðŸ”“ Open &amp; decentralized | ðŸ¤« Privacy-focused | ðŸŒŽ Compatible with multiple providers | . Design Principles . | Open &amp; Decentralized â€“ Anyone can build and host an OPDX-compatible instance. Which server, framework or language to use is completly in the hands of developers, as long as the instance complies with the OPDX specification. | Privacy-Conscious â€“ No authentication required. Rate-limiting and caching are optional, but should be considered. | DNS-Based Discovery â€“ Clients discover OPDX servers using a simple TXT record. There is no need for a central instance or directory of instances. | Minimal &amp; Lightweight â€“ The protocol mandates simple REST API requests and responses using a standardized JSON format. | .
